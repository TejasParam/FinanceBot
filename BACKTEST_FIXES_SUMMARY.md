# Backtesting System Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed:

1. **Import Errors** ✅
   - Changed `AgenticPortfolioManager` to `AgentCoordinator`
   - Removed dependency on `technical_analysis_enhanced`
   - Added self-contained technical indicator calculations

2. **Directory Structure** ✅
   - Fixed nested `backtesting/backtesting` directory issue
   - Proper structure now: `backtesting/` with subdirectories

3. **Technical Agent** ✅
   - Removed external dependency
   - Added built-in RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands calculations

4. **Market Timing Agent** ✅
   - Fixed pandas Series comparison in HFT signals
   - Fixed iceberg order detection

## Remaining Issues:

1. **Series Comparison Error**
   - Still occurring somewhere in the agent stack
   - Happens when analyzing with historical data
   - Need to trace through each agent

2. **Missing Ticker Symbols**
   - VIX should be `^VIX`
   - VXN should be `^VXN`
   - DXY not available on free Yahoo Finance

## How to Test:

```bash
# From project root
cd backtesting
python backtest_runner.py --year 2023 --quick
```

## Notes:

The backtesting system is mostly functional but needs debugging of the pandas Series comparison error that's occurring during agent analysis. The error suggests a conditional statement is trying to evaluate a pandas Series directly instead of using proper Series methods.
