## Configuration

1. Set up API keys in `config.json`:
```json
{
    "finnhub_api_key": "your_finnhub_key",
    "newsapi_key": "your_newsapi_key",
    "alpaca_api_key": "your_alpaca_key",
    "alpaca_secret_key": "your_alpaca_secret"
}
```

2. Configure trading parameters in `config.json`

## Usage

### Running the Trading System
```bash
python run_backtest.py
```

python test_perfect_conditions.py
```

### Running Individual Agents
```python
from agents.coordinator import AgentCoordinator

coordinator = AgentCoordinator()
signal = coordinator.analyze('AAPL')
print(f"Signal: {signal['action']}, Confidence: {signal['confidence']}")
```
